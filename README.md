# Description
Howdy! This rootin' tootin' Pomodoro timer is for all Aggies gunnin' to grab their academics by the horns. Use the timer to separate your work into custom time intervals of intense focus sessions and breaks. A long break will occur after four focus sessions. 

# Inspiration
The Pomodoro time management technique was the initial inspiration for the project. The original timer uses a tomato kitchen timer to break tasks up into time intervals and breaks. As college students, we understand the importance of proper time management and this tool seeks to address that need.

# What it does
Our project is a western themed Pomodoro timer that allows the user to input custom time intervals for intense focus sessions, short breaks, and long breaks. In order for heightened task productivity we implemented a "To Do List" at the bottom of the page for the user to keep track of their session goals.

# How we built it
We started off by trying to create a simple countdown timer using HTML and JavaScript. Congruently we were also creating assets and drafting how the page and to do list would look. After we had a simple countdown timer with low functionality we worked towards allowing the user to set a variable time for their focus session and breaks. Then, we automated the clock to seamlessly switch between the session and breaks.

# Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we faced were making the timer flawlessly switch between time allocated for focus sessions and breaks. Also, the timer would go into the negatives instead of stopping at zero. Finally, the real challenge came when the countdown timer had to be changed to be variable in order for the web app to be catered to the user.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Firstly, we all gained a lot of experience with using git hub , especially dealing with merge conflicts. This is super important as GitHub is the main collaborative tool used in industry

# What we learned
For many of us this was the first time using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Through this projects creation we all expanded on our knowledge in these languages and our ability to create highly interactive websites.

# What's next for Pomorodeo
One of the main things we would add to this web app is a feature where the student can have an accountability check after each study session where they can reflect on their productivity. We also would have liked to add audio capabilities to the timer to alert the user of changing intervals.
